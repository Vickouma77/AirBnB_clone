# AirBnB clone - Web static
This project is a user interface design for the AirBnB website, implemented using HTML and CSS, with special attention to accessibility using ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes. The goal of the project is to create a replica of the AirBnB homepage, including its various sections and elements, while ensuring that it is fully accessible to all users.
